      <h4 class="h_tag">WHO</h4>
      <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 2.6 billion people cook and 
        heat using polluting open fires or simple stoves fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, 
        animal dung and crop waste) and coal (Air Pollution Data Portal, n.d.). This generates 
        high levels of health-damaging Indoor Air Pollution (IAP), such as particulates, tar 
        and carbon monoxide. Because women are primarily responsible for cooking and raising 
        young children, both are disproportionately affected by IAP. For example, the World 
        Health Report (2002) states that in developing countries among the poor, Acute Respiratory
        Infection (ARI) is one of the leading causes of childhood mortality (under 5) and is 
        responsible for up to 33% of all ARI cases. IAP also adversely affects Zimbabwe because 
        of the number of people who live in poor, rural regions. (Rural Population (67% of Total 
        Populationâ€¦2020) - Zimbabwe | Data, n.d.). A second problem caused by open or traditional 
        heaths is the inefficient use of fuel. Past efforts to reduce IAP have focused on efficient 
        combustion but have not necessarily focused on thermal efficiency of the overall cooking and 
        heating process. As a result, a significant portion of the fuel's energy is lost, leading to 
        increased levels of deforestation. In parallel, people who are faced with the challenge of 
        indoor air pollution are from low-income communities which makes it very difficult for 
        them to afford expensive clean cooking stoves. Most of the existing solution focus only 
        on reduction of Indoor Air Pollution, but fall short on distribution the solution to 
        billions of people who need it.</p>

      <h4 class="h_tag">IAP Reduction System</h4>
      <p class="p_tag">Because of the above issues, the engineering goal of this experiment is 
        to create pattern designs of creating an affordable, simple, and efficient cooking system 
        whose design is based on origami. Origami is the Japanese technique of creating complex 
        3-dimensional objects from flat sheets of paper. All that is needed to make a well known 
        object such as a Crane, Cube or Lion is the pattern and a piece of paper. Likewise, the 
        clean cooking system's components will be fabricated from flat metal sheets using simple 
        folds and cuts, enabling them to be made worldwide without complex fabrication techniques. 
        Additionally, if a component;s pattern is known, it can produce it using locally available 
        material and tools. This reduces or eliminates funding and production bottlenecks that have 
        limited the impact of prior efforts when attempting to produce and distribute billions of 
        units worldwide. Since many regions that suffer from indoor air pollution also have 
        electricity shortages, the practicality of using the thermoelectric chips to generate 
        electricity from the cooking stove's waste heat is evaluated. Its cost per watt hour is 
        compared to alternatives such as simple solar panels with local storage (batteries or super 
        capacitors.)</p>
